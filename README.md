Hello!

My name is Kenny Jung, and I am a rising second year at UC Merced. I recently switched majors to Computer Science and Engineering, so I'm just playing around with whatever platforms I can use. 

I really enjoy basketball as well! I root for the Los Angeles Lakers, the team my favorite player Kobe Bryant played for 20 years.
